# how to keep my growth mindset?

* When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it.
* My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else. 
*  often judge my days based on my mood at the end. My worst days are when I haven’t managed to get things together, I’ve procrastinated and wasted time, and I find myself with very little to look back on positively.
