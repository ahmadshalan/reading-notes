# Chapter 3 : Lists.

types of lists:

### Ordered lists 
are lists where each item in the list is numbered. The ordered list is created with the <'ol'> element.

### Unordered lists 
are lists that begin with a bullet point. The unordered list is created with the <'ul'> element.


### Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.


The definition list is created with the <'dl'> element and usually consists of a series of terms 
and their definitions. Inside the <'dl'> element you will usually see pairs of <'dt'> and
<'dd'> elements.


* <'dt'>
This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
* <'dd'>
This is used to contain the definition.


### Nested lists:

You can put a second list inside an <'li'> element to create a sublist or nested list.





# Chapter 13 : Boxes.

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance: 

1. Border : The border separates the edge of one box from another.

2. Margin : Margins sit outside the edge of the border. 

3. Padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

### White space & Vertical Margin

Designers refer to the space between items on a page as white space.

### border-width: 
The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. 


### border-style:

You can control the style of a border using the border-style property. 

### border-color:
You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names

### Shorthand 'border':

The border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property.

### IE6 Box model:

When we specify the width of a box, any padding or margin should be added to the width of it. 
Internet Explorer 6,has a quirk whereby it includes the padding and margins in the width of the box.
it is the IE6 model.
