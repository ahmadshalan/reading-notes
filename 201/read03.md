# Chapter 3 : Lists.

types of lists:

### Ordered lists 
are lists where each item in the list is numbered. The ordered list is created with the <'ol'> element.

### Unordered lists 
are lists that begin with a bullet point. The unordered list is created with the <'ul'> element.


### Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.


The definition list is created with the <'dl'> element and usually consists of a series of terms 
and their definitions. Inside the <'dl'> element you will usually see pairs of <'dt'> and
<'dd'> elements.


* <'dt'>
This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
* <'dd'>
This is used to contain the definition.


### Nested lists:

You can put a second list inside an <'li'> element to create a sublist or nested list.





# Chapter 13 : Boxes.

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance: 

1. Border : The border separates the edge of one box from another.

2. Margin : Margins sit outside the edge of the border. 

3. Padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

### White space & Vertical Margin

Designers refer to the space between items on a page as white space.

### border-width: 
The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. 


### border-style:

You can control the style of a border using the border-style property. 

### border-color:
You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names

### Shorthand 'border':

The border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property.

### IE6 Box model:

When we specify the width of a box, any padding or margin should be added to the width of it. 
Internet Explorer 6,has a quirk whereby it includes the padding and margins in the width of the box.
it is the IE6 model.

### Hiding boxes 'visibility':

The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.

This property can take two
values:
* hidden:
This hides the element.
* visible
This shows the element.


### Border images:

The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background
image and slices it into nine pieces. 

### Box shadows :

The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.

### Rounded corners:

CSS3 introduces the ability to create rounded corners on any box, using a property called
border-radius. The value indicates the size of the radius in pixels.

### border-radius:

To create more complex shapes, you can specify different distances for the horizontal and
the vertical parts of the rounded corners.

# Review for Chapter 2 : Basic JavaScript Instruction:

#### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable.
The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array. 




# Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops:


### Switch statement:

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

### Loops:

* for
* while
* do while
