# Chapter 1: Structure
### How pages uses structure?
Good structur helps the users to understand the content and how to go through it, like the newspaper.
### Structuring word documents
The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information.

### HTML Describes the structure of pages 
The HTML code ( is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

"Tags" act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

<> : this is calles opening tag
</>: this is called closing tag

"Attributes" provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# Chapter 8 : Extra Mark up

### Doctype : 
each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. also the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.

### ID Attribute :
It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

### Class Attribute :
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. 

### Block Elements:

Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. 

Ex. : <'h1'>, <'p'>, <'ul'>, and <'li'>.


### Inline Elements :
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as *inline elements*.

### Escape Characters
There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)

# Chapter 17 : HTML5 Layout 

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

### Headers and Footers:

The <'header'> and <'footer'> elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
* A header or footer for an individual <'article'> or <'section'> within the page.

### Navigation :

The <"nav"> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

### Articles :
The <'article'> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.

### Asides :
The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

### Sections:

The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

### Heading Groups:

he purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 

# Chapter 18 : Process and Design:

### Who is the site for:

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

### Why People Visit YOUR Website:

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

### What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. You can then assign the list of tasks to the fictional visitors you created in the step described on the previous page.

### What Information Your Visitors Need

You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

### How Often People Will Visit Your Site

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

### Site Maps :
The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.

### WireFrames:

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

# Chapter 1 : ABC of Programming:

### A : What is a script and how do  I create one?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Fter knowing your goal you have to design a script flowchart.

### B : How do computers fit in with the world around them?

Computers creat models of the world using data.

models use objects torepresent physical things. Each object can have its own:
* Properties
*  Events
*  Methods

### C : How do I write a script for a web page ?

Using the *Document* and the *Write*. the programmer refer to this as calling the method of an object.
