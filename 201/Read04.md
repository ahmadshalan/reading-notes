Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

## Writing Links

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag 
and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Linking to Other Sites

Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing
 </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.

## Linking to othe pages on websites.

pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. 
You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

## Directory Structure:
On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different 
section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

## Relatives URL 
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way
of telling the browser where to find your files.

## Opening Links in a New Window
use 'target' If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank

### You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## Building Blocks:


CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

* Block-level elements :start on a new line Examples include: <h1> <p> <ul> <li>.

* Inline elements: flow in between surrounding text Examples include: <img> <b> <i>.

## Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

## Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page
: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. 

You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements 
using the float property.

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell 
the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

* Fixed Positioning This is a form of absolute positioning that positions
the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed 
positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.

* Floating Elements Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level
element around which other content can flow.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts 
of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
