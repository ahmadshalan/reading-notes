1. @ media : rule inside of an existing style sheet.
2. @ import : importing a new style sheet. <br />

Ex.:

5. braille.

 ## Aspect Ratio Media Features

 The aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio features specifies the width/height pixel ratio of the targeted rendering area or output device.

 ## Resolution Media Feature

 The resolution media feature specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density, also known as dots per inch or DPI. 

 ## Mobile First:

 includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

 ## Viewport:

 Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width. nfor best results applying the device-height and device-width values.

One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%.
